# Gene Expression Atlas

**Gene Expression Atlas** is a standalone tool for generating interactive HTML reports from normalized gene expression data.  
It is based on the expression atlas module originally developed for [EasyGDB](https://github.com/easygdb/easy_gdb), adapted for broader use and simplified deployment.

## ðŸ§ª Features

- **Input**: a normalized expression matrix (e.g., RPKM/TPM), a list of gene identifiers to plot, and an optional gene annotation table.
- **Output**: an interactive HTML report with line plots, bar charts, and a heatmap.
